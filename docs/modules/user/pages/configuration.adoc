[#data_setup]
== Where apps will store permanent data?

Since Wolf supports multiple streaming sessions at the same time and each session can run a different app, we need to make sure that each app has its own folder where it can store permanent data. +
To achieve this, for each running app, Wolf will create a folder structure like this:

[source]
----
${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/${app_state_folder}/${app_title}
----

and then mount that as the home (`/home/retro`) for the docker container that will run the selected app. +

These 3 variables are defined as follows:

* `HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER`: defaults to `/etc/wolf`, can be changed via ENV
* `app_state_folder`: defaults to a unique identifier for each client so that every Moonlight session will have its own folder.
Can be changed in the `config.toml` file
* `app_title`: the title of the app as defined in the `config.toml` file

=== Change the `HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER`

Changing this folder via ENV variable is not enough; Wolf expects to be able to access files under this folder, so you need to make sure that the new folder is created and mounted in the Wolf container. +

For example, if you want to change the `HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER` to `/mnt/drive/wolf` you need to change the docker run command with:

* `-e HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER=/mnt/drive/wolf`
* `-v /mnt/drive/wolf:/mnt/drive/wolf:rw`

== TOML file

The TOML configuration file is read only once at startup (or created if not present) and it'll be modified by Wolf only when a new user is successfully paired.

.Default TOML configuration file
[source,toml]
....
hostname = "wolf"   #<1>
support_hevc = true #<2>
config_version = 2 #<3>
uuid = "0f75f4d1-e28e-410a-b318-c0579f18f8d1" #<4>

paired_clients = [] #<5>
apps = [] #<6>
gstreamer = {} #<7>
....

<1> *hostname*: this is the name that will be displayed in the list of hosts in the Moonlight UI
<2> *support_hevc*: when set to `false` will disable support for HEVC in Moonlight
<3> *config_version*: The version of this config file
<4> *uuid*: a randomly generated UUID, it's used by Moonlight to know if the current host has already been paired
<5> *paired_clients*: a list of all the Moonlight clients that have succesfully completed the pairing process; it'll be populated by Wolf and saved to this file.
<6> *apps*: a list of apps, see: xref:_defining_apps[]
<7> *gstreamer* audio/video pipeline definitions, see xref:_gstreamer[]

[#_defining_apps]
=== Defining apps

Apps defined here will be shown in Moonlight after successfully pairing with Wolf. +
You can re-define parts of the Gstreamer pipeline easily, ex:

[source,toml]
....
[[apps]]
title = "Test ball" #<1>
start_virtual_compositor = false #<2>
app_state_folder = "some/folder" #<3>

[apps.runner] #<4>
type = "process"
run_cmd = "sh -c \"while :; do echo 'running...'; sleep 10; done\""

[apps.video] #<5>
source = """
videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true !
video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1
\
"""

[apps.audio] #<6>
source = "audiotestsrc wave=ticks is-live=true"
....

<1> *title*: this is the name that will be displayed in Moonlight
<2> *start_virtual_compositor*: set to True if this app needs our custom virtual compositor (TODO: document this better)
<3> *app_state_folder*: the folder where the app will store permanent data, see: xref:data_setup[]
<4> *runner*: the type of process to run in order to start this app, see: xref:_app_runner[]
<5> *video*: here it's possible to override the default video pipeline variables defined in: xref:_gstreamer[]
<6> *audio*: here it's possible to override the default audio pipeline variables defined in: xref:_gstreamer[]

See more examples in the xref:gstreamer.adoc[] page.

=== Override the default joypad mapping

By default, Wolf will try to match the joypad type that Moonlight sends with the correct mapping.
It is possible to override this behaviour by setting the `joypad_mapping` property in the `apps` entry; example:

[source,toml]
....
[[apps]]
title = "Test ball"
joypad_type = "xbox" # Force the joypad to always be xbox
....

The available joypad types are:

* `auto` (default)
* `xbox`
* `nintendo`
* `ps`


[#_app_runner]
==== App Runner

There are currently two types of runner supported: `docker` and `process`

==== Process

Example:

[source,toml]
....
[apps.runner]
type = "process"
run_cmd = "sh -c \"while :; do echo 'running...'; sleep 10; done\""
....

==== Docker

Example:

[source,toml]
....
type = "docker"
name = "WolfSteam"
image = "ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge"
mounts = [
  "/run/udev:/run/udev:ro"
]
env = [
  "PROTON_LOG=1",
  "RUN_SWAY=true",
  "ENABLE_VKBASALT=1"
]
devices = []
ports = []
base_create_json = """ #<1>
{
  "HostConfig": {
    "IpcMode": "host",
    "CapAdd": ["SYS_ADMIN", "SYS_NICE"],
    "Privileged": false
  }
}
\
"""
....

<1> *base_create_json*: here you can re-define any property that's defined in the docker API JSON format, see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.40/#tag/Container/operation/ContainerCreate[docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.40]

[#_gstreamer]
=== Gstreamer

In here we define the default pipeline for both video and audio streaming to Moonlight. +
In order to automatically pick up the right encoder at runtime based on the user HW we run in order the list of encoders at `gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders` (and `gstreamer.video.h264_encoders`); the first set of plugins that can be correctly initialised by Gstreamer will be the selected encoder for all the pipelines.

You can read more about gstreamer and custom pipelines in the xref:gstreamer.adoc[] page.

[#_multiple_gpu]
== Multiple GPUs

When you have multiple GPUs installed in your host, you might want to have better control over which one is used by Wolf and how. +
There are two main separated parts that make use of HW acceleration in Wolf:

* Gstreamer video encoding: this will use HW acceleration in order to efficiently encode the video stream with H.264 or HEVC.
* App render node: this will use HW acceleration in order to create virtual Wayland desktops and run the chosen app (ex: Firefox, Steam, ...)

They can be configured separately, and ideally you could even *use two GPUs at the same time* for different jobs; a common setup would be to use the integrated GPU just for the streaming part and use a powerful GPU to play apps/games.

=== Gstreamer video encoding

The streaming video encoding pipeline is fully controlled by the `config.toml` file; here the order in which entries are listed is important because Wolf will just try each listed plugin; the first one that works is the one that will be used.

[NOTE,caption=EXAMPLE]
====
If you have an Intel iGPU and a Nvidia card in the same host, and you would like to use QuickSync in order to do the encoding, you can either:

* Delete the `nvcodec` entries under `gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders`
* Cut the `qsv` entry and paste it above the `nvcodec` entry
====

On top of that, each single `apps` entry support overriding the default streaming pipeline; for example:

[source,toml]
....
[[apps]]
title = "Test ball"

# More options here, removed for brevity...

[apps.video]
source = """
videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true !
video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1
\
"""
....

In case you have two GPUs that will use the same encoder pipeline (example: an AMD iGPU and an AMD GPU card) you can override the `encoder_pipeline` with the corresponding encoder plugin; see:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/1167[gstreamer/issues/1167].

=== App render node

Each application that Wolf will start will have access only to a specific render node even if the host has multiple GPUs connected. +
By default, Wolf will use the env variable `WOLF_RENDER_NODE` which defaults to `/dev/dri/renderD128`

[TIP]
====

If you don't know which render node is associated with which GPU you can use the following command:

[source,bash]
....
ls -l /sys/class/drm/renderD*/device/driver
/sys/class/drm/renderD128/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu <1>
/sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia <2>
....

<1> This line will tell you that `renderD128` is a virtual GPU
<2> This line will tell you that `renderD129` is a Nvidia GPU

====

Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the `config.toml` config file by setting the `render_node` property; example:

[source,toml]
....
[apps.runner]
type = "docker"
name = "WolfSteam"
image = "ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge"

# More options here, removed for brevity...
render_node = "/dev/dri/renderD129"
....
